This userscript that will look at all the text on the page and attempt to convert non-english words into Kana.
It will also copy the old text to the "title" attribute of any HTML elements it converts, so if you hover over the text, you will see the original text.
If the element already had a title attribute, the old text will be added to the end of the existing title attribute, placed in parentheses.

It's not perfect (because the English dictionary it uses is not perfect, and also because it will convert some non-english words), but it works well enough for my use.
